//: > _Note:_ Build the GEOSwift framework scheme targeting an iOS Simulator prior to use this Playground.
//: You may have to close and reopen the project after building it.
//: # GEOSwift
//: _The Swift Geographic Engine._
//:
//: Easily handle geographical objects (points, linestrings, polygons etc.) and the main related topographical
//: operations (intersections, overlapping etc.).
//: GEOSwift is basically a MIT-licensed Swift interface to the OSGeo's GEOS library routines*, plus some convenience
//: features for iOS developers as:
//:
//: * A pure-Swift, type-safe, optional-aware programming interface
//: * Automatically-typed geometry deserialization from WKT and WKB representations
//: * MapKit and MapboxGL integration
//: * Quicklook integration
//: * A lightweight GEOJSON parser
//: * Extensively tested
//:
//: ### Handle a geographical data model
//:
//: GEOSwift let you easily create geometry objects for all the geometry types supported by GEOS:
//: 
//: * Point
//: * LineString
//: * Polygon
//: * MultiPoint
//: * MultiLineString
//: * MultiPolygon
//: * GeometryCollection
//: 
//: Geometries can be deserialized from and serialized back to their Well Known Text (WKT) or Well Known Binary (WKB)
//: representations, as they are defined in the _[Simple features for SQL](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sfa)_
//: specification.
//: The default spatial reference system for geometry fields is WGS84 (meaning the SRID is 4326) â€“ in other words, the
//: geometry coordinates are in longitude, latitude pairs in units of degrees.
// Create a POINT from its WKT representation.
let point = Waypoint(WKT: "POINT(10 45)")

// A geometry can be created even using the constructor `Geometry.create(WKT)` and casting the returned value to the
// desired subclass.
let geometry1 = Geometry.create("POLYGON((35 10, 45 45.5, 15 40, 10 20, 35 10),(20 30, 35 35, 30 20, 20 30))")

// The same geometry can be represented in binary form as a Well Known Binary.
let WKB: NSData = geometryWKB()
let geometry2 = Geometry.create(WKB.bytes.assumingMemoryBound(to: UInt8.self), size: WKB.length)

if geometry1 == geometry2 && geometry1 != point {
    print("The two geometries are equal!\nAh, and geometry objects conform to the Equatable protocol.")
}

// Examples of valid WKT geometries representations are:
// POINT(6 10)
// LINESTRING(35 10, 45 45, 15 40, 10 20, 35 10)
// LINESTRING(3 4,10 50,20 25)
// POLYGON((1 1,5 1,5 5,1 5,1 1),(2 2, 3 2, 3 3, 2 3,2 2))
// MULTIPOINT(3.5 5.6,4.8 10.5)
// MULTILINESTRING((3 4,10 50,20 25),(-5 -8,-10 -8,-15 -4))
// MULTIPOLYGON(((1 1,5 1,5 5,1 5,1 1),(2 2, 3 2, 3 3, 2 3,2 2)),((3 3,6 2,6 4,3 3)))
// GEOMETRYCOLLECTION(POINT(4 6),LINESTRING(4 6,7 10))
//: ### Mapkit integration
//:
//: Convert the geometries to a MKShape subclass, ready to be added as annotations to a MKMapView
//:
let shape1 = point!.mapShape()!
let shape2 = geometry1?.mapShape()!
let annotations = [shape1, shape2]
//: ### Quicklook integration
//:
//: GEOSwift geometries are integrated with Quicklook!
//: This means that while debugging you can inspect complex geometries and see what they represent: just stop on the
//: variable with the mouse cursor or select the Geometry instance and press backspace in the Debug Area to see a
//: preview.
//: In Playgrounds you can display them just as any other object, like this:
geometry2
//: ### GEOJSON parsing
//:
//: Your geometries can be loaded from a GEOJSON file.
//:
if let geoJSONURL = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "multipolygon", withExtension: "geojson"),
    let features = try? Features.fromGeoJSON(geoJSONURL),
    let italy = features.first?.geometries?.first as? MultiPolygon {

    italy
//: ### Topological operations:
//:
    italy.buffer(width: 1)
    italy.boundary()
    italy.centroid()
    italy.convexHull()
    italy.envelope()
    italy.envelope()?.difference(italy)
    italy.pointOnSurface()
    italy.intersection(geometry2!)
    italy.difference(geometry2!)
    italy.union(geometry2!)
//: ### Predicates:
//: 
    italy.disjoint(geometry2!)
    italy.touches(geometry2!)
    italy.intersects(geometry2!)
    italy.crosses(geometry2!)
    italy.within(geometry2!)
    italy.contains(geometry2!)
    italy.overlaps(geometry2!)
    italy.equals(geometry2!)
    italy.relate(geometry2!, pattern: "T*****FF*")
}
//: [GEOS](http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/) stands for Geometry Engine - Open Source, and is a C++ library, ported from the
//: [Java Topology Suite](http://sourceforge.net/projects/jts-topo-suite/). GEOS implements the OpenGIS [Simple Features
//: for SQL](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sfs) spatial predicate functions and spatial operators. GEOS, now
//: an OSGeo project, was initially developed and maintained by [Refractions Research](http://www.refractions.net/) of
