Easily handle a geometric object model (points, linestrings, polygons etc.) and
related topological operations (intersections, overlapping etc.). A type-safe,
MIT-licensed Swift interface to the OSGeo's GEOS library routines.

## Migrating to Version 5 or Later

Version 5 constitutes a ground-up rewrite of GEOSwift. For full details and help
migrating from version 4, see [VERSION_5.md](VERSION_5.md).

## Features

* A pure-Swift, type-safe, optional-aware programming interface
* WKT and WKB reading & writing
* Robust support for *GeoJSON* via Codable
* Thread-safe
* Swift-native error handling
* Extensively tested

## Requirements

* iOS 9.0+, tvOS 9.0+, macOS 10.9+, watchOS 2.0+ (Swift Package Manager, CocoaPods)
* Linux (Swift Package Manager)
* Swift 5.3

> GEOS is licensed under LGPL 2.1 and its compatibility with static linking is
at least controversial. Use of geos without dynamic linking is discouraged.

## Installation

### CocoaPods

1. Update your `Podfile` to include:

        use_frameworks!
        pod 'GEOSwift'

2. Run `$ pod install`

### Swift Package Manager

1. Update the top-level dependencies in your `Package.swift` to include:

        .package(url: "https://github.com/GEOSwift/GEOSwift.git", from: "9.0.0")

2. Update the target dependencies in your `Package.swift` to include

        "GEOSwift"

In certain cases, you may also need to explicitly include
[geos](https://github.com/GEOSwift/geos.git) as a dependency. See
[issue #195](https://github.com/GEOSwift/GEOSwift/issues/195) for details.

## Usage

### Geometry creation

```swift
// 1. From Well Known Text (WKT) representation
let point = try Point(wkt: "POINT(10 45)")
let polygon = try Geometry(wkt: "POLYGON((35 10, 45 45.5, 15 40, 10 20, 35 10),(20 30, 35 35, 30 20, 20 30))")

// 2. From a Well Known Binary (WKB)
let wkb: NSData = geometryWKB()
let geometry2 = try Geometry(wkb: wkb)

// 3. From a GeoJSON file:
let decoder = JSONDecoder()
if let geoJSONURL = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "multipolygon", withExtension: "geojson"),
    let data = try? Data(contentsOf: geoJSONURL),
    let geoJSON = try? decoder.decode(GeoJSON.self, from: data),
    case let .feature(feature) = geoJSON,
    let italy = feature.geometry
{
    italy
}
```

### Topological operations

Let's say we have two geometries:

![Example geometries](/README-images/geometries.png)

GEOSwift let you perform a set of operations on these two geometries:

![Topological operations](/README-images/topological-operations.png)

### Predicates:

* _equals_: returns true if this geometric object is “spatially equal” to
  another geometry.
* _disjoint_: returns true if this geometric object is “spatially disjoint” from
  another geometry.
* _intersects_: returns true if this geometric object “spatially intersects”
  another geometry.
* _touches_: returns true if this geometric object “spatially touches” another
  geometry.
* _crosses_: returns true if this geometric object “spatially crosses’ another
  geometry.
* _within_: returns true if this geometric object is “spatially within” another
  geometry.
* _contains_: returns true if this geometric object “spatially contains” another
  geometry.
* _overlaps_: returns true if this geometric object “spatially overlaps” another
  geometry.
* _relate_: returns true if this geometric object is spatially related to
  another geometry by testing for intersections between the interior, boundary
  and exterior of the two geometric objects as specified by the values in the
  intersectionPatternMatrix.

### Playground

Explore more, interactively, in the playground, which is available in the
[GEOSwiftMapKit](https://github.com/GEOSwift/GEOSwiftMapKit) project. It can be
found inside `GEOSwiftMapKit` workspace. Open the workspace in Xcode, build the
`GEOSwiftMapKit` framework and open the playground file.
