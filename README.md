[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/andreacremaschi/GEOSwift.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/andreacremaschi/GEOSwift.svg?branch=develop)
[![CocoaPods Compatible](https://img.shields.io/cocoapods/v/GEOSwift.svg)](https://img.shields.io/cocoapods/v/GEOSwift.svg)

Easily handle a geographical object model (points, linestrings, polygons etc.) and related topographical operations (intersections, overlapping etc.).  
A type-safe, MIT-licensed Swift interface to the OSGeo's GEOS library routines, nicely integrated with MapKit and Quicklook.

## Features

* A pure-Swift, type-safe, optional-aware programming interface
* Automatically-typed geometry deserialization from WKT and WKB representations
* *MapKit* and *MapboxGL* integration
* *Quicklook* integration
* A lightweight *GEOJSON* parser
* Extensively tested

## Requirements

* iOS 8.0+ / Mac OS X 10.10+
* Xcode 8
* Swift 3
* CocoaPods 1.0.1+

## Usage

### Geometry creation

```swift
// 1. From Well Known Text (WKT) representation
let point = Waypoint(WKT: "POINT(10 45)")
let polygon = Geometry.create("POLYGON((35 10, 45 45.5, 15 40, 10 20, 35 10),(20 30, 35 35, 30 20, 20 30))")

// 2. From a Well Known Binary (WKB)
let WKB: NSData = geometryWKB()
let geometry2 = Geometry.create(WKB.bytes, size: WKB.length)

// 3. From a GeoJSON file:
if let geoJSONURL = NSBundle.mainBundle().URLForResource("italy", withExtension: "geojson"),
    let geometries = Geometry.fromGeoJSON(geoJSONURL),
    let italy = geometries[0] as? MultiPolygon
{
    italy
}
```

### MapKit and MapboxGL integration

GEOSwift makes it easy generate annotations to display on a mapview using Apple MapKit and [MapboxGL](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/).
On each Geometry instance you can call one of the related convenience func `mapShape()` or `mapboxShape()`, that will return an annotation object ready to be added as annotations to a `MKMapView` (for MapKit) or `MGLMapView` (for MapboxGL):

Example for MapKit:

```swift
let shape1 = point.mapShape() // will return a MKPointAnnotation
```

Example for MapboxGL:

```swift
let shape1 = linestring.mapboxShape() // will return a MGLPolyline
```

In this table you can find which annotation class you should expect when calling `mapShape()` or `mapboxShape()` on a geometry:

| WKT Feature | GEOSwift class | MapKit | MapboxGL |
|:------------------:|:-------------:|:-----------------:|:-----------------:|
| `POINT` | `WayPoint` | `MKPointAnnotation` | `MGLPointAnnotation` |
| `LINESTRING` | `LineString` | `MKPolyline` | `MGLPolyline` |
| `POLYGON` | `Polygon` | `MKPolygon` | `MGLPolygon` |
| `MULTIPOINT` | `MultiPoint` | `MKShapesCollection` | `not supported` |
| `MULTILINESTRING` | `MultiLineString` | `MKShapesCollection` | `not supported` |
| `MULTIPOLYGON` | `MultiPolygon` | `MKShapesCollection` | `not supported` |
| `GEOMETRYCOLLECTION` | `GeometryCollection` | `MKShapesCollection` | `not supported` |

Of course you should provide your implementation of the mapview delegate protocol (`MKMapViewDelegate` or `MGLMapViewDelegate`).
In MapKit, when dealing with geometry collections you have to define your own `MKOverlayRenderer` subclass.
Currently geometry collections are not supported when using `MapboxGL`.

### Topological operations

Let's say we have two geometries:

![Example geometries](/README-images/geometries.png)

GEOSwift let you perform a set of operations on these two geometries:

![Topological operations](/README-images/topological-operations.png)

### Predicates:

* _equals_: returns true if this geometric object is “spatially equal” to another geometry.
* _disjoint_: returns true if this geometric object is “spatially disjoint” from another geometry.
* _intersects_: returns true if this geometric object “spatially intersects” another geometry.
* _touches_: returns true if this geometric object “spatially touches” another geometry.
* _crosses_: returns true if this geometric object “spatially crosses’ another geometry.
* _within_: returns true if this geometric object is “spatially within” another geometry.
* _contains_: returns true if this geometric object “spatially contains” another geometry.
* _overlaps_: returns true if this geometric object “spatially overlaps” another geometry.
* _relate_: returns true if this geometric object is spatially related to another geometry by testing for intersections between the interior, boundary and exterior of the two geometric objects as specified by the values in the intersectionPatternMatrix.

## Installation

> **Embedded frameworks require a minimum deployment target of iOS 8 or OS X Mavericks.**
> GEOS is a configure/install project licensed under LGPL 2.1: it is difficult to build for iOS and its compatibility with static linking is at least controversial. Use of GEOSwift without CocoaPods and with a project targeting iOS 7, even if possible, is advised against.

### CocoaPods

CocoaPods is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. To install GEOSwift with CocoaPods:

* Make sure CocoaPods is installed (GEOSwift requires version 0.39.0 or greater).

* Update your `Podfile` to include the following:

```
use_frameworks!
pod 'GEOSwift'
```

* Run `pod install`.

NOTE: running `pod install` may cause some errors if your machine does not have autoconf, automake and glibtool, if you encounter those errors you can run `brew install autoconf automake libtool` to install those packages and run again `pod install`.

### Swift Package Manager

The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the `swift` compiler.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding GEOSwift as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`.

```swift
dependencies: [
    .Package(url: "https://github.com/petrpavlik/GeoSwift.git", majorVersion: 1)
]
```
